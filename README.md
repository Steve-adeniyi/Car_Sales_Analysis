## 🎯 Project Goals
To conduct an in-depth analysis of the
automotive market to understand factors
influencing vehicle selling prices and market
trends.

## 📈 Key Aims and Objectives
+ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Identify and analyse descriptive statistics and trends
related to vehicle characteristics (year, make, model, trim, body type, transmission,
colour).
+ Condition and Mileage Impact Analysis: Determine the relationship between vehicle
condition rating, odometer
+ Market Value Assessment: Compare the Manheim Market Report (MMR) values
(estimated market value) with the actual selling prices to analyse market fluctuations
and pricing differences
+ Predictive Modelling: Develop and evaluate a model to accurately predict a vehicle's
selling price based on its various attributes.
+ Derive Business Insights: Provide actionable insights for automotive professionals
regarding consumer preferences, market demand, and effective pricing strategies.

## 💰 Revenue Performance Summary

| Category  |Peak Performance | Key Driver/Value | Lower Performance | Value/Contrast|
|:---------|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|---------:|
| Annual Revenue    |  2015    |   92.01% of total revenue |    2014    |   7.99% (Remaining Share) |
|Average Annual Rev.  | 2015   | 90.37% of total revenue   |2014    |    9.63% (Remaining Share) |
| Quarterly Revenue  | Q1 2015  | 61.56% |Q2, Q3, Q4 2014  |    0.00% (Registered No Revenue) |
| Monthly Revenue | Feb 2015 | 29.10% (Highest)| Feb 2014  |     0.00% (Negligible) |
| Manufacturer (Avg. Rev.) |Ford | 24.42% (Highest Contributor)  | Kia  |    4.72% (Lowest Contributor) |
|Vehicle Mileage (Monthly) | Low Odometer | 42.21% |High Odometer  |    0.41% |
| Vehicle Mileage (Annual) | Low Odometer (2015) | 92.01% |High Odometer (2014)  |     7.99%|
| Transmission Type | Automatic  | 85.05% | Manual |     2.45% |
| Exterior Color | Black | 50.90%  | Yellow |    0.00% |
| State Revenue | Florida | 18.77% (Highest)| Missouri |     4.37% (Lowest) |

## 💡 Key Actionable Insights
+ Focus on Ford and Low-Mileage Inventory: Ford and low-mileage vehicles are
overwhelmingly the highest revenue generators.
+ Prioritise Automatic Transmission and Black Vehicles: Given that Automatic
transmission contributes 85.05% of revenue and the Black colour segment contributes
50.90%, marketing and acquisition efforts should prioritise these specifications to
maximise sales efficiency.
+ State Expansion/Allocation: Florida, accounting for 18.77% of revenue, represents a
high-yield market. Resources and inventory allocation should be optimised to support
this region, while exploring strategies to boost performance in lower-contributing states
like Missouri (4.37%)
+ Model Seasonality and Disparity: The dramatic difference between 2015 (92.01%
revenue) and 2014 (7.99%) suggests either a massive expansion, a change in reporting, or
extreme market volatility.

## 🧭 Recommendation
Leverage the comprehensive vehicle
attributes—including Year, Make, Model,
Odometer Reading, Condition Rating, and
MMR Values—to develop a robust
predictive model capable of accurately
estimating selling prices.
